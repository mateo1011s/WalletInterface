#### Description
> &gt; &nbsp;The task involves creating a wallet program that allows users to purchase and sell items using a Java-based interface. The program should enable users to input an amount and then click either a 'Purchase' or 'Sale' button to execute the transaction. Upon completing a transaction, a receipt is generated containing the product ID, transaction date, transaction type (purchase or sale), and the amount. The initial balance of the wallet is $100, which is updated accordingly after each transaction
#### How does this program help us?
>  &gt; &nbsp; It helps us keep track of our money to know how much we have spent or obtained, the dates of these transactions and know how much money we have in total.
